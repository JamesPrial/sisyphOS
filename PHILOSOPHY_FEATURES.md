# Philosophy & Dialogs Feature Documentation

## Overview
The Philosophy & Dialogs feature adds an inescapable dialog system and philosophical content throughout SisyphOS, creating an absurdist experience where users must accept reality as presented.

## Components Created

### 1. Dialog Component (`src/components/Dialog.jsx`)
**Inescapable modal dialog with the following features:**
- Semi-transparent dark overlay that blocks all interaction
- Only "OK" button available (no cancel, no X to close)
- ESC key is disabled (preventDefault on keydown)
- Clicking outside does nothing
- Centered on screen with fade-in animation
- Clean, minimalist design with shadow and rounded corners

**Props:**
- `title` - Dialog title text
- `message` - Dialog message content
- `onOK` - Callback when OK button is clicked
- `isOpen` - Boolean to control visibility

### 2. Philosophy Data (`src/data/philosophy.js`)
**Comprehensive collection of philosophical content:**

- **15 Camus Quotes** - Authentic quotes from Albert Camus about absurdism
- **15 Absurdist Errors** - System errors with philosophical undertones:
  - "Error: Meaning not found. Did you expect to find it?"
  - "Fatal exception: Purpose.exe has stopped responding"
  - "Error 404: Existential crisis not handled"

- **8 Circular Help Topics** - Self-referential documentation that loops:
  - Getting Started ‚Üí Advanced Topics ‚Üí Troubleshooting ‚Üí Getting Started
  - Help with Help ‚Üí Help (infinite loop)
  - Finding Documentation ‚Üí Help system ‚Üí Finding Documentation

- **12 Philosophical Notifications** - Subtle reminders:
  - "Your actions are both meaningful and meaningless"
  - "You are free to choose, but you must choose"
  - "Consciousness continues despite everything"

### 6. usePhilosophyNotifications Hook (`src/hooks/usePhilosophyNotifications.js`)
**Automated notification system:**

**Parameters:**

## Design Philosophy

**Inevitability:** Dialogs cannot be escaped, reflecting the inescapable nature of existence.

**Absurdism:** Circular help and meaningless errors embrace the absurd.

**Acceptance:** The only option is "OK" - users must accept and move forward.

**Subtlety:** Notifications are gentle, not annoying - timing is carefully calibrated.

**Humor:** Professional documentation makes the circularity funnier.

**Accessibility:** Even limited dialogs have proper ARIA markup.

## Usage Examples

### Manual Dialog Trigger
```javascript
const [showDialog, setShowDialog] = useState(false);

<Dialog
  title="System Notice"
  message="You are using SisyphOS. This is normal."
  onOK={() => setShowDialog(false)}
  isOpen={showDialog}
/>
```

### Manual Notification
```javascript
const { addNotification } = usePhilosophyNotifications();

addNotification("The boulder has reached the bottom again.", 5000);
```

### Error Dialog from ErrorSimulator
Click "Generate Error" button ‚Üí Dialog appears ‚Üí User must click OK ‚Üí Dialog closes

## Conclusion

The Philosophy & Dialogs feature successfully creates an acceptance-based dialog system with rich philosophical content. All components work together seamlessly to create an absurdist user experience that is both thought-provoking and playful.
